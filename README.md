# SOC-2025
My SOC project is RL with Doom where I need to train AI agents to play the game "Doom".
Tracks my progress in tasks and has all code for the tasks given till now.
This repo has my weekly task submissions and till now 5 weeks are over. 
The reading material is provided to us in Google classroom hence I am not including that here.
It has the copies of all repositories given to us for the weekly tasks.

There is no task for week5 and below is the link to a video explaining how my code works for task-4.
