From the Main branch on my forked and cloned repository, I have created a new branch "finished-task1" in which a file "task1.md" was created. It has details regarding what was done in task1. 
The file is saved and committed as "added task1.md". These changes are pushed to the forked repository. From there a pull request is created to the upstream repository.
